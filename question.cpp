 An organization has two types of employees: regular and adhoc. Regular employees get a salary which is
  basic+ DA + HRA where DA is 10% of basic and HRA is 30% of basic.
  Adhoc employeesare daily wagers who get a salary which is equal to number* wagewhere number is number ofdays.
 (i) Define the classes shown in the following class hierarchy diagram.

 (ii) Define the constructors.
  When a regular employee is created, basicmust be a parameter. When adhoc employee is created wagemust be a parameter.

  (iii) Define the destructors.

  (iv) Define the member functions for each class. 
 The member function days(int n)updates salary ofthe Adhoc employee.

 (v) Write a test program to test the classe

 Create  an abstract  class  shape.  
 Derive  three  specific  classes  called  triangle,  rectangle  and  circle. Using  these  four  classes,  d
 esign  a  program  that  will  accept  dimensions  of  a  triangle, rectangle or circle interactively, and display the area.


 Write a program to create a base class named “circle”. Derive another class  “cylinder”  from  it.  
 The  program  should  calculate  total  surface  area  of  circle  and cylinder using the concept of inheritance. 
 Circle should  have data  fieldsi.e.radius, area and  method  getRadius()  should  take 
  value  of  radius  from  user.  Cylinder  should  have additional  data  fieldi.e. height 
   and  additional  method  getHeight()  to  assign  value  of height.  Similarly, 
 area() function calculatesarea and display() function prints the final area of the created objects i.e circle and cylinder

   When  each  object  is  created,  its  constructor  can  examine  this  count  member variable  to  determine  
   the  appropriate  serial  number  for  the  new  object.  Then  write  a main() program that creates three objects

    Create a class called publicationthat stores the title(a string) and price(type float) of a publication. 
     From  this  class  derive  two  classes: book,  which  adds  a page_count(type int);  and tape,  which  
     adds  a  playing time_in_minutes(type  float).  Each  of  the  three classes  
    should  have  a getdata()  function  to  get  its  data  from  the  user,  and 
     a putdata() function to display the data.
     Implement publicationclass to be an abstract  and achieve  run time polymorphism with well driven C++ program.

      Write a complete C++ program that demonstrates multiple inheritance. 

      Write a class called Birdthat contains a string member and a static int. I
      n the default constructor, use the int to automatically generate an identifier that you build in the string, 
      along with the name of the class (Bird #1, Bird #2, etc.). Add an operator<< for ostreams to print out the Bird objects.
       Write an assignment operator= and a copy-constructor. In main( ), verify that everything works correctly

       In the base class, make a virtual function called draw( ), and override this in the derived classes. 
       Make an array of pointers to Shape objects that you create on the heap (and thus perform up-casting of the pointers), 
       and call draw( ) through the base-class pointers, to verify the behavior of the virtual function. 
       If your debugger supports it, single-step through the code. (It is okay to make draw() pure virtual function).
 
 
       Discuss the advantages of using function template. Write a function template printArraythat declares a 
       single template parameter T (T can be any valid identifier) for the type of the array to be printed by function printArray.
        Write a driver program that inputs, and outputs an int array and a float array.
